We use Aggregate Functions. These take many rows and squash them into a single number.

The Big 5:

COUNT(*): Counts how many rows exist.

SUM(Column): Adds up numbers (e.g., Total Sales).

AVG(Column): Calculates the average.

MIN(Column): Finds the smallest value.

MAX(Column): Finds the largest value.

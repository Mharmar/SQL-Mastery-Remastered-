The Concept: WHERE vs. HAVING
This is the most common interview question for Junior SQL Developers. Memorize this.

WHERE: Filters rows before they are grouped.

Example: "I only want to count people whose Name starts with 'J'." (Filters Jhon, Justin).

HAVING: Filters groups after they are aggregated.

Example: "I only want to see Departments that have more than 2 people."

The Analogy:

WHERE is the bouncer at the club door. He checks ID before you get in.

HAVING is the VIP manager inside. He checks which tables bought the most bottles.
